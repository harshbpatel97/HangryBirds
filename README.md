<h2>The Problem </h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is no platform available at the moment to review individual dishes or other menu items from a restaurant or franchise chain.
</li>
    <li>
      Platforms exist to rate the restaurant itself or the service and experience, but not the overall quality, presentation, or freshness of the food items.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Our solution is an application where users can look at the ratings of specific food items that are sold at restaurants or franchise chains. One can browse by looking at the restaurant and find what foods have the best reviews. By searching specific food items and finding restaurants with high rating for the item. HangryBirds will allow the user to view reviews and write reviews of specific food items of a given restaurant.
